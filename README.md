## Fine-Tuning LLM For Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained language model for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset. The process involves loading a base model from Hugging Face, preprocessing the dataset, fine-tuning the model, evaluating its performance, and comparing results to the baseline.

### Objectives
- Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model for sentiment classification.
- Improve performance over the baseline model.
- Implement a structured training pipeline.
- Optimize training using GPU acceleration.

### Implementation Steps

#### Part 1: Design and Planning
- Fine-Tuning Motivation: Sentiment analysis can benefit from fine-tuning, as pre-trained models lack domain-specific nuances.
- Baseline Model: We use nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment.
- Dataset: IMDB dataset with balanced samples.
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy and F1-score.

#### Part 2: Build and Test
1. Environment Setup:
   Install Dependencioes: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Fine-tuning Pipeline:
   - Load dataset and preprocess text.
   - Tokenize and encode input text.
   - Configure training hyperparameters.
   - Train and evaluate the model.
3. Testing
   - Predict sentiment on test samples.
   - Analyze accuracy and errors.

#### Part 3: Optimization, Documentation and Presentation
1. Hyperparameter tuning: Learning rate, epochs and weight decay adjustments.
2. Saving and sharing: save fine-tuned model and tokenizer, document model details in a model card.
3. Documentation and reporting: training logs, metrics visualization and lessons learned.
4. YouTube Walkthrough: 15-minute presentation explaining implementation and results.

### Challenges and Solutions
- Data Imbalance: Balanced dataset by sampling equal positive and negative reviews.
- Overfitting: Adjusted dropout and weight decay.
- Training Time: Optimized with mixed precision and batch size tuning.

### Conclusion
Fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model significantly improves sentiment classification accuracy. The process highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
