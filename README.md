## Fine-Tuning LLM For Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained language model for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset. The process involves loading a base model from Hugging Face, preprocessing the dataset, fine-tuning the model, evaluating its performance, and comparing results to the baseline.

### Objectives
- Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model for sentiment classification.
- Improve performance over the baseline model.
- Implement a structured training pipeline.
- Optimize training using GPU acceleration.

### Implementation Steps
#### Part 1: Design and Planning
- Fine-Tuning Motivation: Sentiment analysis can benefit from fine-tuning, as pre-trained models lack domain-specific nuances.
- Baseline Model: We use nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment.
- Dataset: IMDB dataset with balanced samples.
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy and F1-score.
